# Website Design Project ðŸŽ¨

This page contains potential ideas for styling your web page. It covers the following aspects:

* Colours
* Fonts
* Text Styles

## Technologies

I used HTML5 and CSS3 for this project. I applied CSS flexbox to help style the page. 
As I continue my learning journey, I'm enjoying applying the new techniques I have learnt to each project in order to better my code, as well as the appearance of each project.
